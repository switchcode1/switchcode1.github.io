    <h2>The Kinkajou</h2>
      <p>The kinkajou , or honey bear , is related to racoons and ringtails
        although they can sometimes be mistaken for ferrets or monkeys.it
        has mainly golden fur which is covered bty some brown fur. They have
        nocturnal habits and they are hunted for their fur and skins. it is
        a mammal that is not that rare but is not often seen. They live inside
        of hollow tree trunks and spend most of their time in trees. They use
        their five inch long toung to get tough to reach fruit which is their
        main diet. Currently they are of least concern on the endangered list.
        Kinkajous are manipulative creatures who sleep in groups. They do not
        like being awake in the day and if you disturb them they may attack.

      <h2>The Blue Morpho Butterfly</h2>
      <p>The blue morpho is one of the largest butterflies discovered. It is a
         large bright blue winged butterfly with a wingspan of roughly seven
         inches. The wings are edged with black and on the underside there are
         many eye spots with a dull brown colour for camouflage. When it flies
         the contrasting colours make it appear as if it is disappearing and
         appearing. They have the same physical structure as all butterflies.
         They have a lifespan of only 115 days. This means they have to focus on
         eating and reproducing. As a caterpillar it eats leaves and pea like
         plants. Adults have a part on their mouth (the proboscis) to suck the
         juice out of dead fruits. They also eat tree sap and wet mud. As an
         adult it can not chew so it drinks. </p>

      <h2>Epiphytes</h2>
      <p>Eiphytes live off of other plants since they primarily have no direct
        connection to the ground through roots or otherwise. Because of this
        they have found other ways to gain nutrients by harmlessly draining
        moisture and nutrients from other plants. Even though they seem like
        them they technically aren't plants (please say this is ok) they are
        actually epibionts which's literal translation is "live on top of".
        Some of the epiphytes found in the rainforest are:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Bromeliads</li>
        <li>Orchids</li>
        <li>Cacti</li>
        <li>Lichens</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just to name a few</p>

    <h2>The Rattan Palm</h2>
    <p>The Rattan Palm is a species of tree climbing palms. They are
      found in the African, Asian and Austrialasian rainforests. The Rattan
      Palms are actually vines not trees. They have hooked spines on their stems
      to help them climb trees. These palms are used in furniture. Some may grow
      up to 90 metres to get sunlight and the leaves have water in them although
      that may not be that useful in a place called the rainforest. They have
      feather shaped leaves which have some smooth edges. They show up regularly
      along the stem</p>
